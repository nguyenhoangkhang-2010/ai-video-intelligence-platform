# Overview

AI Video Intelligence Platform is an end-to-end AI system that transforms long-form videos into structured, searchable knowledge.

Instead of watching a 2-hour lecture or meeting, users can:

- Read concise summaries
- Search for concepts instantly
- Chat with the video
- Generate quizzes
- Create flashcards
- Extract action items
- Translate subtitles
- Discover key moments

The platform combines Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Vector Search, and Large Language Models into a single intelligent pipeline.

---

# Problem Statement

Modern video content is growing rapidly:

- University lectures
- Technical talks
- Podcasts
- Business meetings
- Webinars
- YouTube tutorials

Watching everything is time-consuming.

Users need a smarter way to extract knowledge from videos.

Current tools usually provide only subtitles or simple summaries.

This platform aims to transform videos into searchable knowledge bases.
